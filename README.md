# Event CRUD

Over the course of the week, we will allow users to CRUD events:

Events have the following fields:

* Date (date)
* Location (string)
* Description (text)
* Capacity (integer)
* Requires ID (boolean)

To make this work:

* `cd ~/workspace`
* git clone this repo
* cd into the `g4-crud-week4` directory
* Run `bundle`
* Run `rake db:create`
* Create a TODO list somewhere (could be a text file, a moo.do list, on paper etc...)
* Take a minute to write down the things you'd like to do, in the order you'd like to do them
* As you finish each task, check off the item you've completed
